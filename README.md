### How to use `theiaide/theia` image?

Theia is actively being developed. It is recommended to use `theiaide/theia:latest` if you want the latest stable release of Theia or `theiaide/theia:next` if you want the most recent version of Theia at the time the image was built (bleeding edge).

The following pulls the image and runs Theia IDE on http://localhost:3000 with the current directory as a workspace. The option of `--init` is added to fix the [defunct process problem](https://github.com/theia-ide/theia-apps/issues/195).

    # Linux, macOS, or PowerShell
    docker run -it --init -p 3000:3000 -v "$(pwd):/home/project:cached" theiaide/theia:next

    # Windows (cmd.exe)
    docker run -it --init -p 3000:3000 -v "%cd%:/home/project:cached" theiaide/theia:next


You can pass additional arguments to Theia after the image name, for example to enable debugging:

    # Linux, macOS, or PowerShell
    docker run -it --init -p 3000:3000 --expose 9229 -p 9229:9229 -v "$(pwd):/home/project:cached" theiaide/theia:next --inspect=0.0.0.0:9229

    # Windows (cmd.exe)
    docker run -it --init -p 3000:3000 --expose 9229 -p 9229:9229 -v "%cd%:/home/project:cached" theiaide/theia:next --inspect=0.0.0.0:9229

### Electron Apps

The repository contains example Electron applications which are packaged using `electron-builder`. Following the steps provided in their respective README, it is possible to build and package the applications for Desktop use.

| Application Name | Description | Documentation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `theia-cpp-electron` | Theia-based C/C++ desktop IDE | [docs](./theia-cpp-electron/README.md) |
| `theia-electron` | Theia-based JavaScript/TypeScript (Web Technologies) desktop IDE | [docs](./theia-electron/README.md) |

## VS Code Extensions

Many applications in the repository now include support for running VS Code extensions, and an integration to the public instance of [open-vsx registry](https://open-vsx.org/), an open alternative to the Visual Studio Marketplace. The `Extensions` view can be opened through the `Views` top-level menu when starting the application.

## Tips & Tricks

- #### Build Options:
    - `--init` injects an instance of [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini) in the container, that will wait-for and reap terminated processes, to avoid leaking PIDs.
    - `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined` enables running without [the default seccomp profile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/) for debugging. This option is also required if the swift REPL is needed.
