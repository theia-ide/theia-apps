## Theia Docker

[![dockeri.co](http://dockeri.co/image/theiaide/theia)](https://hub.docker.com/r/theiaide/theia/)

`theiaide/theia` image contains an example of Theia based IDE for Web Developers.

### How to use `theiaide/theia` image?

At the moment Theia is still in [active development](https://github.com/theia-ide/theia#roadmap). It is recommended to use [`theiaide/theia:next`](#typefoxtheianext) image to have a look at the current state.

This script pulls the image and runs Theia IDE on http://localhost:3000 with the current directory as a workspace. The option of `--init` is added to fix the [defunct process problem](https://github.com/theia-ide/theia-apps/issues/195).

    # Linux, macOS, or PowerShell
    docker run -it --init -p 3000:3000 -v "$(pwd):/home/project:cached" theiaide/theia:next
    
    # Windows (cmd.exe)
    docker run -it --init -p 3000:3000 -v "%cd%:/home/project:cached" theiaide/theia:next


You can pass additional arguments to Theia after the image name, for example to enable debugging:

    # Linux, macOS, or PowerShell
    docker run -it --init -p 3000:3000 --expose 9229 -p 9229:9229 -v "$(pwd):/home/project:cached" theiaide/theia:next --inspect=0.0.0.0:9229
    
    # Windows (cmd.exe)
    docker run -it --init -p 3000:3000 --expose 9229 -p 9229:9229 -v "%cd%:/home/project:cached" theiaide/theia:next --inspect=0.0.0.0:9229
